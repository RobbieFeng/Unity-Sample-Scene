# Automated Bug Sampling Tool

## Overview

This program automates the process of creating bug samples in Unity scenes under the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) using the Perception Package. It captures bug instances and records them for analysis.

## Requirements

### Import Package by Name:
- `com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition`
- `com.unity.perception`

### Import Package by URL:
- [AutoLOD](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AutoLOD.git)
- [UnityMeshSimplifier](https://github.com/Whinarn/UnityMeshSimplifier.git)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Import Scene**: Import the scene into the project and ensure it supports HDRP rendering.

2. **Add GameArea Object**: Under `Assets/My_Objects`, add a "GameArea" object to the scene. Ensure all relevant objects are contained within this area as it defines the boundaries for bug sampling.

3. **Insert Capture Camera**: Add a "Capture Camera" object to the scene. This is essentially a camera with the Perception Camera Component. Alternatively, you can add the Perception Camera Component to any camera and replicate the settings of the provided Capture Camera object.

4. **Configure ControlBlock**: Add a ControlBlock object to the scene and specify the "GameArea" and camera under its settings.

5. **Integrate Bug Controller**: Add one instance of the Bug Controller prefab to the scene. Only one Bug Controller should be active for the program to function correctly.

6. **Run the Program**: Execute the program to initiate bug sampling.

## Post-Processing and Analysis

7. **Review Output**: After execution, JSON files containing bug samples should appear under the `[out/]` directory within the project's main directory.

8. **Execute Post-Processing Script**: Run `process.py` located in the project's main directory. This script generates finalized samples under `[out/]`, replacing previous JSON files. Additionally, it deletes all files generated by the Perception Package in its default location.

9. **Clean-up Previous Files**: If the post-processing script is not executed, manually delete previous Perception files before subsequent runs. Paths to these images are recorded in `PathToCapturedImages.txt` within the project's main directory, which is generated if the program runs correctly.

10. **Optional Manual Filtering**: Utilize `picViewer.py` to view and manually filter samples located in `[out/]`.

## Note
- This sample scene doesn't work well with the program. For all the bug controllers to work normally, each item's collider and renderer should not be separated into two objects.
